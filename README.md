# Sevens-card-game
A Java-based implementation of the classic card game Sevens (known as Cinquillo or Fives in Spain). The game supports 1 to 4 players, with optional CPU-controlled opponents filling the remaining seats. Players take turns placing cards in ascending or descending order around the starting card — the 5 of Golds begins the game. Featuring a fully text-based interface, the project enforces valid moves and offers a simple yet engaging way to play Sevens entirely in English.
