# Sevens-card-game
A Java-based implementation of the classic card game Sevens (known as Cinquillo [Fives] in Spain).
The game supports 1 to 4 players, allowing the remaining spots to be filled by CPU opponents.
Players take turns placing cards in ascending or descending order around the starting card (the 5).
Player with the 5 gold starts.
The game features a fully text-based interface, enforces valid moves, and provides a simple, engaging way to play Sevens entirely in English.
